# Game of Life Simulator

This program is a simulator of John Conway's Game Of Life. (more info there:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

It allows the user to select the initial configuration of alive cells beetwen classic configurations (such as Glinders and Blinkers), random configurations and user-selected-configurations from mouse. 

The UI is done entirely in PyGame, so it's very simple and allows the navigation only throug keyboard input.
